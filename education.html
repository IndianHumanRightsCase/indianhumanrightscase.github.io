            <h2>Denial of Education: A Tool of Persecution</h2>
            <p>The campaign of persecution against my family was not limited to physical violence and death threats; it included a systematic and malicious effort at my college, <strong>Seth Ganga Sagar Jatiya Polytechnic in Khurja, Bulandshahr</strong>, to destroy my future by denying me my fundamental right to education. This was not a simple administrative issue; it was a deliberate tool of punishment, detailed in a formal 4-page complaint I submitted to the Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh (dated approx. 14/01/25).</p>
            <h3>Phase 1: Harassment and Violent Assaults by College Staff</h3>
            <p>The targeted harassment began in late 2023. On October 10, 2023, after I asked a technical question in the plumbing workshop, teacher <strong>Avinash Jain</strong> responded with a xenophobic remark and beat me with an iron rod, causing injuries to my hand and thigh. When I reported this to the Principal, <strong>Dr. R.K. Singh</strong>, he also assaulted me and threatened to expel me from the college.</p>
            <p>The situation escalated severely on October 16, 2023. After I asked a grammatical question in class, the teacher, <strong>Shikha Sharma</strong>, unable to answer, called for another teacher, <strong>Priyanka Singh</strong>. Priyanka Singh took me outside, verbally abused me and my father (who was not present), sexually assaulted me, and then threatened to have me killed, boasting that her husband was a Commissioner and her father was a police officer.</p>
            <h3>Phase 2: Administrative Abuse and Physical Prevention from Exams</h3>
            <p>The physical and sexual assaults were followed by administrative attacks designed to cripple my academic progress. Teacher <strong>Avinash Jain</strong> arbitrarily stopped my scholarship funds. On November 2, 2023, <strong>Priyanka Singh</strong> falsely informed me that I had been rusticated and warned me not to appear for my sessional exams. On November 20, 2023, she incited the entire student body against me by spreading false rumors that I was a threat, forcing them to write false complaints against me.</p>
            <p>This campaign culminated on December 1, 2023, when I arrived at the college. I was physically blocked from entering the college by teachers <strong>Priyanka Singh</strong> and <strong>Gajendra Singh</strong>. When I tried to leave, I was ambushed and attacked by the college peon, <strong>Kishan Lal</strong>, and a group of incited students. This was a clear attempt on my life, carried out in the presence of Principal <strong>Dr. R.K. Singh</strong> and other staff. I sustained serious injuries to my head and leg.</p>
            <h3>Phase 3: Police Complicity and Obstruction of Justice at All Levels</h3>
            <p>My attempts to seek help from the authorities were met with complicity and further abuse. I went directly to the Khurja Police, showed them my injuries from the December 1st attack, and pleaded for a medical examination; they refused. My case was overseen by the CO of Khurja, whose assistant, <strong>Virendra Singh</strong>, later forced me to sign a "settlement" form under duress. The police accepted the college staff's baseless claims that I was "mentally unstable" and closed the case without any real investigation, ignoring my requests to check the college's CCTV footage.</p>
            <p>The obstruction of justice was not limited to the local police station. When I escalated my complaint about the college to higher authorities, I was met with more threats. This demonstrated that the cover-up was being enforced by higher levels of the police, leaving me with no safe avenue to seek help.</p>
            <h3>The Outcome: A Future Destroyed</h3>
            <p>As a result of this coordinated campaign of violence, administrative abuse, and police complicity at multiple levels, I was completely forced out of my education. I have lost many years of study, and my academic future is in ruins. To this day, the college is holding my Transfer Certificate (TC), effectively preventing me from enrolling in any other institution in India. The denial of my education was a deliberate and calculated act of persecution, designed to punish me for my identity and to destroy any chance I had of building a future.</p>
