            <p><strong>SAFETY WARNING:</strong> This website details ongoing, life-threatening persecution by Indian state agents against a Muslim family. The specific names of the victims have been anonymized in this public version to protect them from severe and certain reprisals. The names of the alleged perpetrators, who are public officials or individuals acting with impunity, are included to ensure the claims are specific and to seek accountability.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>I am a 20-year-old Indian national from a Muslim family. On behalf of my father, mother, older brother, and younger sister, I am telling our story of survival against a relentless campaign of state-sponsored terror in a district of western Uttar Pradesh.</p>
            <p>We are a Muslim family enduring severe and escalating persecution by state agents (Uttar Pradesh Police) and colluding individuals. Our fundamental human rights are being grossly violated, and we live under constant threat of being killed by the very authorities who should protect us.</p>
            <h3>The Forced Conversion (The Origin of Our Persecution)</h3>
            <p>Our family's ordeal began before 2017 when we were targeted by Indian authorities for our Islamic faith. We were subjected to a forced religious conversion from Islam to Hinduism. This process involved the unjust imprisonment and severe physical torture of my parents by police, and the forcible changing of all our names to erase our Muslim identity.</p>
      <p>This persecution extended to a systematic campaign to deny me my right to education.</p>

            <h3>Escalation of Terror in 2025</h3>
            <h4>Malicious Prosecution and Torture of my Brother</h4>
            <p>In January 2025, my older brother was arrested by officers from Chhatari Police Station based on completely fabricated criminal charges (including molestation and attempted murder supported by a fake medical report) filed by a villager, <strong>Hodal Singh's wife</strong>, with likely police collusion. He was imprisoned for many months in the district jail and subjected to severe torture, including being tied to a tree, beaten with sticks, denied adequate food and water, and denied medical treatment for an extreme fever. To ensure his continued persecution, the same individuals filed a barrage of new false cases against him on May 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 22 & 26, 2025.</p>
            <h4>Attempted Murders and Death Threats by Police</h4>
            <p>On May 14, 2025, at approximately 12:21 PM, <strong>Sub-Inspector Amit Kumar</strong> and two constables from Chhatari Police Station opened fire on our family at our residence. We narrowly escaped death. When my parents reported this to a <strong>Senior Officer of Bulandshahr</strong>, he threatened them into silence. The threats are relentless. <strong>Station Officer (SO) Sandeep Kumar</strong> of Chhatari PS has previously invaded our home multiple times with a gun attempting to shoot me. On June 11, 2025, <strong>SI Amit Kumar</strong> returned to our home again and directly threatened to kill our entire family.</p>
            <h4>Retaliation for Seeking Help</h4>
            <p>Our pleas for justice have been met with direct retaliation. After police officers <strong>Jaiveer Singh</strong> and <strong>Anil Kumar</strong> threatened us with new false cases on June 7, 2025, <strong>SI Amit Kumar</strong> filed new fabricated charges against our entire family on June 9, 2025.</p>

            <h2>Evidence and Failure of Justice in India</h2>
            <p>We have exhausted all domestic remedies.</p>
            <p class="no-help-statement"><strong>No Indian Police, No CBI, No Indian Human Rights Commission, No One In India Has Helped Us.</strong></p>
            <p>Every attempt to file a complaint is met with threats, violence, or further false charges. High-ranking officials are complicit in this cover-up. We have submitted our detailed case and evidence to the UN Special Procedures in Geneva and numerous international human rights organizations.</p>
            <p>Our cases are officially registered with the United Nations. The specific reference numbers can be provided to trusted organizations upon request to verify our claims.</p>

            <h2>Key Evidence</h2>
            <p>We possess significant evidence to substantiate our claims, which can be made available to trusted journalists and human rights organizations through secure channels. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CCTV footage of the police invasion and shooting at our home by <strong>SI Amit Kumar</strong> and constables (May 14, 2025).</li>
                <li>CCTV footage of police (<strong>SI Amit Kumar</strong>) visiting our home to issue death threats (June 11, 2025).</li>
                <li>Video evidence of the physical assault on our family by villagers (<strong>Hodal Singh</strong> and family, May 22, 2025).</li>
                <li>Copies of our detailed (non-anonymized) submissions to the United Nations.</li>
                <li>Documentation related to the multiple false criminal cases filed against us by <strong>Hodal Singh's wife/daughter</strong> and <strong>SI Amit Kumar</strong>.</li>

            <h2>Our Urgent Plea</h2>
            <p>Our lives are in immediate and constant danger in India. We have no protection. We are in so much pain, we fear we could be killed at any moment. Our most urgent need is to leave India and find a secure place in another country where we can live without fear. We are appealing to the international community, journalists, and human rights advocates to bring attention to our plight and help us find a path to safety. Your help could save our lives.</p>
            <p>Please share our story. Please advocate for our protection. Your attention could save our lives.</p>
